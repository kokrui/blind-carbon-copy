# blind carbon copy

~~joke~~ submission for the hackathon iNTUition v8.0, because alongside a spate of other similar incidents including by some local unicorns they didn't use bcc to email-blast all of last year's participants.

installing this chrome extension will close the tab every time you try to add an email to the To:/CC: sections of the compose screen on gmail. also includes a helpful full text of the PDPA for you to peruse.

this obviously has great real-world utility and market value since Google tells me that the maximum financial penalty for contravening the PDPA is "up to 10% of an organisationâ€™s annual turnover in Singapore, or SGD 1 million, whichever is higher". that's a pretty big number that you will save by just using this extension.

infinitely scalable server-wise since it runs client-side, and scalable product-wise since my profits from this product can scale from $0 to <arbitrary large number> x $0.
